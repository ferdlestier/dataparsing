# dataparsing

The idea of this script is to run a showcase on how to parse a csv file, with data from my portfolio using only pandas.

## Error Handling and Logging Practices

To ensure the robustness and reliability of the `parser.py` script, error handling and logging have been significantly improved. These enhancements aim to catch potential errors during data parsing or file operations and provide a structured approach to monitoring and debugging the script's execution.

### Viewing and Interpreting Logs

The `parser.py` script now generates logs that can be found in the `parser.log` file. These logs include timestamps, log levels, and messages that describe the script's execution flow and any errors encountered. To view the logs, simply open the `parser.log` file with a text editor or a log viewer tool.

By analyzing the logs, users can gain insights into the script's behavior, identify any issues that occurred during execution, and understand the context in which these issues happened. This information is invaluable for debugging purposes and for improving the script's performance and reliability.
